# Metronome_PCB

| ‚ùó NOTE          |
|:---------------------------|
| This design is still work in process. PCB has been confirmed to work on breadboard, but actual PCB is still in mail. After the PCB has been confirmed to be functioning properly, I will add BOM and design an enclosure for it. |

## Description

This metronome PCB is based on a simple 555 oscillator producing frequency adjustable square wave with 0.5 dutycycle. In addition the board contains CD4017BE counter circuit that can be used to drive two separate LEDs so that one flashes either every 2, 3 or 4 beats while the other flashes on every beat. The length of a bar can be chosen by separate switch or just hardwired for specific one.

The metronome works with supply voltage of 5 to 15 V, 9V battery is recommended and works well for this purpose. Note that the voltage used may affect the loudness of the speaker. Loudness can also be affected by a separate volume resistor.
